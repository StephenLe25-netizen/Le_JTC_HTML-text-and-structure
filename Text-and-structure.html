            <h3>Trading Card Games</h3>
            <p>
                <p>His first introduction into trading card games was through his older brother, Hai, and his friends. Hai is 10 years older, and started playing Magic the Gathering with his friends. Stephen would spend hours each day pondering the magic of the cards. He didn't fully grasp the fact that it was a game, and never asked to learn. Instead, he would pour over his brothers binders of cards, wondering what mysteries they hid. When He became older, Pokemon became the most popular card game in the world. He bought some cards, and played with his friends, not knowing the similarities both games shared. While incarcerated, he met a few people who had Magic the Gathering cards. They slowly tought him how to play, and within the year he had spent hundreds of dollars purchasing cards. The illusion of the perfect deck plagued his conciousness every waken moment of his life. Life spiralled. Although he became one of the best players in the prison--his decks spoken about as legends--he never felt complete. And through time, he faded into obsurity. Some say he went insane. Mad with obsession. Others say that he had acheived the impossible. Having finally built the perfect deck, the world could no longer contain his enlightenment, and he transcended. Still, others believe that his passion and ultimate failure was enough to ignite his planeswalker spark. Finally, a small obscure sect of the Magic the Gathering players, known as Bardians, said he was accepted into a prestegious and hidden brotherhood that required a trial by fire called, "Senior Project!"</p>

            <h3>Role Playing Game</h3>
            <p>
                <p>His introduction to tabletop roleplaying games was in prison. Some friends of his were speaking strangely. They spoke about "quests" where they committed numerous crimes such as theft, kidnapping, and even murder. However, it was as if everything was in a coded language. He thought, "Surely, they can't honestly believe in the efficacy of their coded langed?" So, as any good friend would do in that situation, he offered a suggestion to how better sheild their conversation. To his surprise, he learned that they were speaking about a Dungeons & Dragons. After making fun of his friends, and making sure they felt bad about themselves, he asked what the game was about. One of his friends, Eric, offered to host a SciFi version of the game called Starfinder. Having recently beating his addiction the Magic the Gathering, he spent hundreds of dollars buying Starfind books. He obsessed over building the perfect character. He spent countless hours pouring over character classes and specifications. He created spreadsheets to compare various builds consisting of different feats and attributes in every class. As time progressed, a familiar fealing set in. A fealing that has become like an old friend. The desire to pursue the impossible, and dread of not reaching his goal. What can be done? Is this all life has to offer him? Misery? It then dawned on him. Unlike Magic the Gathering, tabletop roleplaying games are ran by a game master. A role that comes with the ultimate powers to do anyting, including breaking the rules of the game, and making up roles. In short, a god! From that point forward, Stephen left his lowly life as a player, and took on the mantle of the god <em>Game Master!</em></p>
